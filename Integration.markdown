Integration Sub-Team

With Extended Reality (XR) technologies, a continuous interface to both the real and virtual worlds is required. The integration team focuses on configuring the realistic environment simulations for the head mounted displays (HMDs), as well as develop the networking technologies for talking between cloud databases and HMDs. This involves creating a high fidelity Lunar environment within the Unity game engine and much development and test of the User Interface.
