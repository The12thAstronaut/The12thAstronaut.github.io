With Extended Reality (XR) technologies, a continuous interface to both the real and virtual worlds is required. The integration team focuses on configuring the realistic environment simulations for the head mounted displays (HMDs), as well as develop the networking technologies for talking between cloud databases and HMDs. This involves creating a high fidelity Lunar environment within the Unity game engine and much development and test of the User Interface.

Team Lead: Jaime Vives

**Jaime Vives** is an aerospace engineering student minoring in computer science, class of 2022.  He enjoys programming videogames and numerical simulations of physics models. He hopes to one day develop a space game that will inspire kids to become engineers, scientists, and pilots for the upcoming martian colonies. Jaime is from Fort Worth, Texas.

Last year, Jaime interned at Microsoft. On a team of three, he helped create a financial data pipeline to detect anomalous transactions in real-time. He will intern there again on the same team to work on finance technology.

On the side, Jaime likes to travel: he's visited Seville, Paris, Rome, and Buenos Aires! He is also on the TAMU Club Swimming team.
