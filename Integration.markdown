title: Integration Team
order: 3
---

With Extended Reality (XR) technologies, a continuous interface to both the real and virtual worlds is required. The integration team focuses on configuring the realistic environment simulations for the head mounted displays (HMDs), as well as develop the networking technologies for talking between cloud databases and HMDs. This involves creating a high fidelity Lunar environment within the Unity game engine and much development and test of the User Interface.

Team Lead: Jaime Vives

**Jaime Vives** is an aerospace engineering student minoring in computer science, class of 2022.  He enjoys programming videogames and numerical simulations of physics models. He hopes to one day develop a space game that will inspire kids to become engineers, scientists, and pilots for the upcoming martian colonies. Jaime is from Fort Worth, Texas.

Last year, Jaime interned at Microsoft. On a team of three, he helped create a financial data pipeline to detect anomalous transactions in real-time. He will intern there again on the same team to work on finance technology.

On the side, Jaime likes to travel: he's visited Seville, Paris, Rome, and Buenos Aires! He is also on the TAMU Club Swimming team.


Team Members:

**Israel Gomez** is a junior Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Technology student here at Texas A&M University. He is interested in creating robotic applications for space exploration, and virtual/augmented aid/simulations. He was born and raised in Houston, TX (go Rockets), and has been involved with the 12th Astronaut Lab since its creation.

When Israel is not busy with classes and the 12th Astronaut Lab, he actively rock climbs and practices guitar. After graduation, Israel would like to enter either the entertainment industry as an engineer, or pursue a career at NASA.

**Cassie Mullins** is a first year Visualization MS student at Texas A&M. She is from Atlanta, Georgia, where she graduated from Georgia Tech with a BS in Computational Media in 2019 and worked as a software developer for NCR. She’s also previously interned as a game developer at Adult Swim and was an undergraduate research assistant in an AR/VR lab. She loves computer graphics and hopes one day to help make tools for artists, developers, and engineers. She loves traveling, hiking, white water rafting on breaks and spends most of her free time during the semester watching movies and playing (and occasionally making) games.
