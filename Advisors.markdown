Faculty Advisor:
**Dr. Ana Diaz Artiles** is an assistant professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. Her interests focus on the engineering, biomedical, and human factors aspects of space exploration, including artificial
gravity, sensorimotor adaptation, space physiology, and human health countermeasures. At Texas A&M she directs the Bioastronautics and Human Performance research lab. She received her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015, where she studied artificial gravity combined with exercise as a countermeasure for spaceflight-related physiological deconditioning. Prior to MIT, Ana worked for five years in Kourou (French Guiana) as a member of the Ariane 5 launch team. Dr. Diaz Artiles has a background in aeronautical engineering from Universidad Politcnica de Madrid (Spain), and SUPAERO in Toulouse 10 (France). She is a 2011 Fulbright fellow and a 2014 Amelia Earhart Fellowship recipient.

Faculty Advisor:
**Dr. Gregory Chamitoff** served as a NASA Astronaut for 15 years, including
Shuttle Missions STS-124,126,134 and Space Station long duration missions
Expedition 17 and 18. He has lived and worked in Space for almost 200 days
as a Flight Engineer, Science Officer, and Mission Specialist. His last mission
was on the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour, during which he performed
two spacewalks, including the last one of the Shuttle era, which also completed the assembly of the International Space Station. 
Chamitoff earned his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly, M.S. in Aeronautics from Caltech, and Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. He also holds a Minor and a Masters in Planetary Science. He is currently aProfessor of Practice in Aerospace Engineering, and Director of the AeroSpace Technology Research & Operations (ASTRO) Laboratory at Texas A&M University. He is co-author and co-editor of Human Spaceflight Operations, a textbook on the lessons learned from the past 60 years of spaceflight. His research includes space robotics, autonomous systems, and the development of collaborative VR simulation environments for space system engineering and mission design.
