<p>The 12th Astronaut Lab is a group of project teams oriented around helping fix challenges in space or flight operations using AR and VR. The lab helps promote team work, camaraderie, and allows for students to get real world experience tackling problems from NASA, the Air Force, or other aerospace companies. The lab helps expand student experience with AR/VR technology, programming, and spaceflight operations.</p>

<p>The main competition the lab is involved in is the NASA Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students (SUITS) competition. The objective of the NASA SUITS competition is to assist in the NASA Artemis program by creating a HUD using a HMD that the team picks to meet the design goals predetermined by NASA. In our teamâ€™s case we choose to develop using the Microsoft Hololens and the Unity engine. There were several goals set out by NASA that were given to us beforehand. The first is to give the astronauts a navigation system that can be used to navigate them to select points of interest on the lunar surface and navigate back to the lander. The second is to allow the AR device to interact with a suit port, to interact with airlocks, and also to display suit telemetry data. The third is for the device to aid in geological sampling and note taking while at the excavation site. The last objective is for the UI to accommodate for differences in lighting while navigating the lunars surface, to make sure the UI controls easily and effectively, and to make sure there is a suitable tutorial that new users of the UI will be able to perform to become accustomed to the UI.</p>
