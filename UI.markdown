The User Interface team designs intuitive Augmented Reality (AR) visor displays for the Hololens 2 and other compatible XR devices. Their main focus this semester is to create 3D hologram overlays to assist with tasks for Lunar Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) operations. Everything is currently developed using Unity 2019.4 LTS, and the main goals priorities to complete by March 2021 are:

â€‹

1. Design an intuitive AR interface for Lunar surface navigation, with multiple available control methods (voice, gesture, etc.).

2. Implement AR Telepresence Whiteboard on HoloLens 2 for real-time guidance through mission scenarios and tasks.

3. Develop floating transparent instruction panels that automatically snap to key points in the surrounding environment and stay within proximity of the user.

4. Superposition of instructional animated holograms within the environment for complex tasks.
