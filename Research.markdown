The team completed research related to Augmented/Virtual Reality efficiency and wrote a research paper. The paper, “Design of an AR Visor Display System for Extravehicular Activity Operations,” was accepted to the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference in March 2020 and was presented by Leah Davis. Fall 2109, the research sub-team completed a study on text font and size to determine which would be the most productive. Due to the importance of astronaut safety and efficiency, the research team now focuses on studies related to warning systems. The studies are IRB sanctioned with focus on layout of the heads up display (HUD) and astronaut independence. This means the team designs multiple studies and runs them in a single semester, compiling the relevant data that influences the direction of the UI team.
